The brackets for single filers are ½ of these amounts. Here are the 2017 brackets for comparison.

Note that the lowest bracket is an increase of two percent from the current 10%. Because of additional proposed tax changes 
(some discussed below), however, this group’s after-tax income would increase by 1.2%, according to the Tax Foundation.

Beyond income tax rates, Trump’s plan has several other very significant tax proposals. First, carried interest would be taxed as ordinary income. 
Carried interest is income to a general parter of a private investment fund. Think hedge funds. This change will hurt the wallets of hedge fund 
managers. 

Second, Trump would repeal the 3.8% Affordable Care Act tax. This change, along with the modified tax brackets, would reduce the top rate from 
43.4% to 33%, a substantial savings.

Third, Trump’s tax plan increases the standard deduction to $30,000 ($15,000 for single filers). The personal exemption will be eliminated. 
And importantly, itemized deductions will be capped at $200,000 ($100,000 for single filers). These changes will benefit the working-class, 
while potentially increasing taxes (although at a lower tax rate) of the wealthy by capping itemized deductions.

In short, every working American’s wallet will get fatter under Trump, with hedge fund managers the one exception.
